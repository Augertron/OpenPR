BUGS
=================================
1. OpenPR-0.0.2 works quite well on Scilab 5.2x version,
   but not on Scilab 5.3x version. One reason is the building of the 
   help files. The documentation system of version 5.3 had a massive
   improvement. Our help files are not compatible with the new version.
2. Since version 5.0, Scilab uses a "GLJPanel" to display grahpics.
   This component are not correctly supported on some platforms. So
   if your configuration doesn't meet the conditions, there might be
   problems when calling graphics related functions of Scilab. Partially
   because of this, we delete the 'demo' module.


=================================
We'll fix the problems in the near future.
